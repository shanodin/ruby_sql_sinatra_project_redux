# Programming & Web Fundamentals

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD (where appropriate)
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

## Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

### MVP:

- A list of all their animals and their admission date
- Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
- Assign an animal to a new owner
- List all the owners and their adopted animals

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for animals/owners
- Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
- Search for animals by breed/type
- Any other ideas you might come up with

### Project Rules

You are required to submit your link to github as soon as it has been created. We will be doing a code review at 12 noon on Wednesday.

Presentations will be held on Thursday.

The project must be built using only:

- Sinatra
- PostGRES SQL
- HTML / CSS
- Ruby

  It must NOT use:

- Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
- JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it
- Authentication

  The instructional team will be on hand to help but we would strongly encourage you to:

  - Try and solve the problem yourself by reading the error message
  - Google specific terms to see if you can find the answer
  - Ask your peers on the same project as you for advice

  Failing this, we will come to your aid and don't spend more than 30 mins stuck on a problem without asking someone for help.

  We want to see lots of meaningful Git commits and the use of TDD where / if appropriate.

### Presentations

For the presentation, you will have a 10 min slot to show off your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

- show pictures of sketches, notes, diagrams from your planning stage
- demo your apps functionality
- talk about one piece of code that you are particularly proud of
- highlight your main learning points

  Try not to:

- Go over the time limit
- Talk through every single line of code
